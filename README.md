Detection of kidney conditions using deep learning with convolutional neural networks

This project aims to develop a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately classify CT images into four classes: cyst, normal, stone, and tumor. The model will be trained on a dataset of CT kidney images from the Kaggle competition

The performance of the model will be measured using the following metrics:

Confusion matrix: This matrix shows the number of predictions that were correct and incorrect for each class.
Accuracy score: This metric measures the percentage of predictions that were correct overall.
The project will be implemented using the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The CT kidney images will be preprocessed to ensure that they are all in the same format and size. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and removing any noise.
Model development: A CNN model will be developed to classify the CT kidney images into the four classes. The model will be trained using the preprocessed images and their corresponding labels.
Model evaluation: The trained model will be evaluated on a held-out test set of CT kidney images. The performance of the model will be measured using the confusion matrix and accuracy score metrics.
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to classify new CT kidney images into the four classes. This can help doctors to diagnose kidney conditions more accurately and efficiently.
